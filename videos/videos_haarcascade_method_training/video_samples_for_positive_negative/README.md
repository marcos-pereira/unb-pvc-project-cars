This folder contain the videos from where we get positive and negative samples for the haarcascade method.

#Positive samples 
The positive samples are generated in the following way:
- Open a video with image clipper
- Draw a rectangle around a car and press S to save the rectangle you draw. It will be printed on the terminal the path to the saved .png. FYI: it is possible to draw and redraw a rectangle and also to shift the rectangle using the left/right mouse button.
- Collect around 10 cars per frame
- After you are done with the frame, press F to go to the next frame

#Negative samples
- They will be generated using the same videos, but when a rectangle is draw, the car will be covered with a black rectangle. (This still need to be done)
